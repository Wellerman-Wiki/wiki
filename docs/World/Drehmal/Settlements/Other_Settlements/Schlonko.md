# Schlonko

![[placeholder.png]]

**Schlonko** is a very small settlement situated at [[Fahrcyle's]] western coast, bordering the mountain range that separates the Fahrcyle and Aklhoroma regions. Being the only settlement in the Fahrcyle region, Schlonko has no roads leading to it, its main entrance being only by port.

Schlonko is an incredibly small and isolated town and is the capital of the Duchy of Hishrin. It is located in the only living forest within the Fahrcyle, on the western coast. 

The town is populated entirely by [[Drehmari]] and is home to a [[Runic Blacksmith]].

Schlonko is composed of no more than ten buildings, most of them being small houses made of spruce, oak, and dark oak wood. 

### Ted's Bait Shop
The first visible building at the town's entrance, Ted's Bait Shop contains various basic fishing-related loot.

### The Ravishing Raftsman Shipbuilders
A small boathouse on Schlonko's coast, featuring a few wooden boats and an assortment of axes. Its western outer wall has a funny meme reference depicted with item frames.

### The Flop
The hamlet's only tavern, located at the western side of Schlonko. It contains a smoker, a clownfish, and wool of various colors in item frames acting as "decoration."

### The Duke's Benelovence Grand Hotel
A small inn southeast of the bait shop. It contains a reception area and two comically small rooms, with room for a bed and nothing more.

### The Duke's Grand Palace
The largest structure in the town by a large margin, the Palace in actuality is the Crystalline Colonnade, a temple devoted to Glacial Elder Loe. Constructed mainly from stone brick, ice, and quartz, it has been reappropriated by the Duke as his personal abode. Alongside the devotion altar to Loe and various offerings, the Duke has made additions of his own, with a haphazardly made wooden throne and a table with a wooden boat for seating. A Relic Vessel can be found under the ice spike in the center of the temple, which the Duke seems to be using to preserve fish.

## Lore
Schlonko acts as the capital of the Duchy of Hishrin, which is ruled by Archduke Hishrin Elsahr Ombahr Drehn-Anyr Hovadchear Vahidson I. The Archduke is depicted to be both highly egotistical and completely incompetent: a a small inn is advertised as a grand hotel named in the Duke's honor, the ruins of a temple to Loe is claimed to be his Palace, his staff of power is a fishing rod. Residents pay expensive tithes to the Duke.

It is possible that residents of the Duchy originated from Aklo'rohma,

A dark grey tent located south of Schlonko contains a diary detailing a Drehmari from Dusps, fleeing to Lorahn'Kahl to escape execution. The Drehmari suffers from a disease seemmingly transforming him into an undead, cursed upon him by a necromancer in Lorahn'Kahl
